=========

## development
I started with designing the model for the repositories, to follow OOP principles, and moved onto the UI components, as it gives flexibility for new UI features. The screens were next, along with their supporting sdks, as well as installation/platform setup, for multiple firebase services like, crashlytics, analytics, performancs etc. I finished up the process by setting up sufficient unit tests, to cover the entire app functionality. 

A different news api was used https://newsapi.org, as the original one was tied to a paid account.

## How to run the app

From the main directory, run (npm run android) for android, and (npm run ios) for ios. To the run (npm t).

## PreRelease

Firebase app distribution was used to distribute the testing version of the app
